Better Privacy

With the release of WordPress 4.9.6, several new tools were put into core that are related to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation or [GDPR].

This plugin rolls back some of those features without affecting WordPress core files. This may be useful for testing purposes, or if your install does not need to follow GDPR regulations [i.e. IoT installs, outside of EU, Nevada USA etc.]

FEATURES:

Deactivate new comment form cookie consent

From the admin dashboard:
click SETTINGS >> PRIVACY

ROADMAP May 26, 2018:

GDPR rolled out this week. I will be adding the ability to toggle privacy features as users request it. Please contact johndeebdd@gmail.com if you would like to make a request.
